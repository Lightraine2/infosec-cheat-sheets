# Laurence's collection of Information Security Notes

This is effectively a dumping ground of 10 years worth of information security learning and work experience. I'm actively building this collection out after getting annoyed with the various note taking locations I've used over the years and felt this was the best way to preserve some knowledge and format it in a way I can easily access what I need and potentially share with others what I have learned.
